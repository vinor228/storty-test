## AI Tools Used

I used **ChatGPT** to help speed up UI structure and layout decisions. Initially, I tried integrating the `shadcn/ui` component library, but ran into some setup issues which took additional time. Due to this, I decided to fall back to inline styles, which are simpler and more familiar for me.

## Design Decisions

The UI is intentionally minimal, focusing on functionality and clarity:

- Each league is displayed in a card format with clear separation between elements.
- Cards are clickable and provide instant feedback by opening the badge image directly under the clicked item, improving user experience.
- I considered implementing a 3x3 grid layout but opted for a more adaptive layout with conditional badge rendering inside the list. This ensures the badge remains visually connected to the corresponding league.

## Time Management Notes

I acknowledge that I missed the ideal time window for submitting this assignment. This was due to needing to respond to and deliver a small urgent fix for a previous project. Additionally, I spent extra time trying to configure a new UI library (`shadcn`) which I hadnâ€™t worked with before. Once I reverted to inline styling, the development process sped up again.

Thank you for your understanding.
